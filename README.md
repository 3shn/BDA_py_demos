# Bayesian Data Analysis
This repository contains some Python demos for the book [Bayesian Data
Analysis, 3rd ed by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).

Currently there are demos for BDA3 Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 and 11. Furthermore there is a demo for PyStan.

The demos were originally written for Matlab by Aki Vehtari and in
2015 translated to Python by Tuomas Sivula.
